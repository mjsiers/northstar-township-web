::: danger Annual Meeting Change Notice
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Annual Meeting on **March 9 2021 @ 8:15pm** will be held 
as a telephone conference call.  The phone numbers and access PINs are posted below.

**Toll-Free Dial-In Number: 1-844-854-2222  PIN Number: 3839349#** <br>
**Cell Phone Dial-In Number: 425-436-6362   PIN Number: 3839349#**  

The Town Board realizes that holding a discussion and votes on the 2022 levy budget or other matters is extremely difficult by telephone call.  The Town Board intends to ask the township electors to recess the March 9 meeting and continue on **June 8, 2021 at 7 pm**, when the township can conduct the annual meeting fully in-person, when we can meet with good airflow, appropriate distancing, and when conditions related to COVID-19 may have improved.  A later date for a safe, in-person meeting will allow a more through discussion and vote on the 2022 Budget, levy and other matters from the residents.  The proposed 2022 budget levy will be provided for review and approval at the summer meeting.
