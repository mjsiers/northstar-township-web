:::danger 2020 November General Election Notice
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the North Star Township Board passed **Resolution #04-20** [(click here)](/township/resolutions/resolution-04-20.md) that designates the St. Louis County Courthouse as the in-person polling place for the 2020 November General Election.  **All registered voters will automatically receive a mail in ballot for this election**.
:::

Update From St. Louis County
----------------------------
The county will automatically mail a ballot, signature envelope, and postage paid return envelope to all registered voters within the precinct. **If you have a person who is a snowbird and they have their mail forwarded, they would have to register to receive an absentee ballot, because mail ballots are not forwarded.**

**If a voter prefers to vote in person, they could do so at either the Auditor’s Office, Duluth Courthouse or the Auditor’s Office, Northland Office building in Virginia. The voter would be able to vote at any time during the absentee period (46-days prior to the election) or up to 8:00 p.m. on election night.** If a person votes in-person seven days prior to election night, they have the option of placing their ballot directly into a ballot tabulation machine. If they vote prior to that during the absentee period, they would place their ballot in an envelope and it would be processed by our absentee ballot board.

We are able to process / count mail and absentee ballots 14 days prior to the election. Once we are in that timeframe, we begin running mail and absentee ballots through our 850 central count machine. We continue running ballots as we receive them. However, no totals are uploaded or printed until after the polls close on election night.

For township election results, the initial results are posted on the Secretary of State’s website once we upload our 850 results. You would be able to see the initial results on election night, once they are uploaded. Typically, we are able to process mail ballots right away, I’m guessing the initial results would be available by 9:00 p.m. at the latest. On election night, our election judges, review totals / summary statements and we would email you a copy of the summary statement the next day.

The township would still be required to meet and certify the results of their township offices.
