## WEB PAGE
Mike Siers reports there is no way to have a link from the personal emails to the township e-mail. Mike reports 
there is a way to count how many people are taking the time to visit the site. Dick Dillon reports he received an 
email from a resident questioning what the speed limit is on Barrs and Briar Lake roads.  Dick informed the caller

decided to only put the minutes from 2020 on the web but if someone wants other minutes they should email the clerk.

Rod Saline reports other people in the township have offered to work on the web site. Dick Dillon made a motion 
seconded by Gary Mantay to approve recommendations 10 and 11.  Motion carried. Rory reports he likes recommendation 
12 for the fire department.  He recommends that recruitment of volunteers to serve on the department must be sure 
they have the time to attend the meetings and training each month.  There is a need to explain the training required 
and who pays for this and also inform them of the benefit of the relief association.  Motion by Dick Dillon, second 
by Gary Mantay to approve recommendation 12 with the addition of Rory's comments.  Motion carried.

## UNFINISHED BUSINESS
Ray Barnes reports he has a new summary sheet and if the board approves Mike will put the report on the web.  Janet 
Keough reports she has spoke with someone who is interested in the clerk position so the supervisors will set up a 
meeting to interview her before the next meeting.

## NEW BUSINESS
Deborah Pomroy reports she has found Chinese mystery snails by the Lost Lake tower that she thinks may have come 
from someone cleaning their shoreline on Little Pequaywan Lake as that was the nearest site of the snails.  The 
best way to get rid of them is to bury them.  She will put a link on the web site or readers to get more information 
about them.  Deb will write a summary sheet for the board on this final report.
