The MATT officer list was received and board members checked for any mistakes and Linda Britton returned the list to the MATT office.

## FIRE DEPARTMENT
Chief Rory Blazevic reports it was very quiet for the department in the last month.  He is working on a grant for turnout gear that is due on Friday.  

## MAINTENANCE
Dick Dillon reports he has fixed some damage from ice falling off the building.  The generator  will need to be moved before next winter as it is too close to the building.

## RECYCLING
Janet Keough reports all is fine with the shed.

## ROAD
Gary Mantay reports the road is getting brown in places and sloppy. He and Rory Blazevic discussed what kind of road work would be needed and they will check the road before bringing the report to the board.

## NEW BUSINESS
Board members discussed fixing the area around the flagpole and town sign in order to be able to post on the sign and to fly the flag.
After the discussion at the recent annual meeting concerning how to get township information to residents in a timely fashion there is work being done by the town board and interested residents with the hope of getting a website up and running before fall.
Board members will be checking with the state and MATT on the rules on holding meetings with video conferences or via phone lines.  There are many townships in the state who are going through this same issue concerning how to do business during this epidemic..  
Motion by Gary Mantay, second by Janet Keough for posting on the township boards to be printed on different colored paper each month so residents would perhaps notice them quicker.
Sue Forbragd asked the board if she could do some cleaning and disposing of old items and they gave her the right to do this.

## JOB DUTIES
The job duties for board members are Jan and Linda to check on how our meetings should be run and purchasing colored paper.

## CLOSING
With no further business this meeting was adjourned at 7:40 pm.
